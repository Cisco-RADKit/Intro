# Intro to RADKit

This repository contains example code that are meant as an introduction to the RADKit API.

The examples are split into multiple sections:
* RADKit RPC API basics - execute CLI on multiple devices, use REST, Swagger, SNMP,... from the REPL
* Simple standalone scripts - wrap your REPL into a script without complex Python setup
* Advanced standalone scripts - how to write fully standalone scripts that do not rely on the RADKit REPL
* Control API - Control RADKit Service by API. Manage the inventory, users, etc. programmatically
